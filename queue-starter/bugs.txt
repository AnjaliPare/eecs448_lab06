BUG 1: enqueue
--enqueue is adding to the front instead of the back
--therefore, peekFront returns the most recent number enqueued rather than the first element enqueued.
--representation of queue is changed from FIFO to LIFO

BUG 2: peekFront
--peekFront does not return the value of the first number enqueued. It records the latest element enqueued and changes every time.

BUG 3: dequeue
--dequeue removes in the last number enqueued because of the bug in enqueue.
--the documentation for dequeue, says that it returns The value of the entry at the front of the queue. But dequeue does not return anything

BUG 4: destructor
--The queue pointer is not set back to null on deletion. Memory is still allocated for the Queue even when the destructor is called. On running valgrind it shows that
  errors are coming from enqueue. The allocs don't match the frees.
